# Ruby Ecosystem Simulator

##  Game Description
Ecosystem Simulator is a terminal-based ecosystem simulator that tracks the changes in local populations of bunnies and wolves on a grid at a tile-by-tile basis and outputs global populations of each species every month as they are born and die by thirst, being eaten, or starvation. At the end of the game, statistical graphs are outputted showing the changes in bunny and wolf global populations across all the months of the game. 

## Launch
Play the game by opening up this  replit: https://replit.com/@JoshCross/FinalEcosystemSimulatorIntegration#main.rb and clicking the green play button at the top to run in the terminal window. Make sure to make your terminal window as wide as possible to fully view the grid.
